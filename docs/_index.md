# What's Fabric?

Fabric is an open-source CLI tool and a configuration language that codifies and automation of the content generation process.

Fabric Configuration Language (FCL) allows users to define the document data requirements and content structure with human-readable configuration files. The files can be version-controlled, reused, and shared.

`fabric` is a reports-as-code tool that renders templates defined in the FCL files into Markdown documents.
