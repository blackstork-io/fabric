## Description
Formats text as code snippet

The content provider is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.


#### Configuration

The content provider doesn't support any configuration parameters.

#### Usage

The content provider supports the following execution parameters:

```hcl
content code {
  # Required string. For example:
  value = "Text to be formatted as a code block"

  # Specifiy the language for syntax highlighting
  #
  # For example:
  # language = "python3"
  #
  # Optional string. Default value:
  language = ""
}
```
