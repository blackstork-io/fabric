{{< plugin-resource-header "blackstork/builtin" "builtin" "v0.4.1" "image" "content provider" >}}

The content provider is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.


#### Configuration

The content provider doesn't support any configuration parameters.

#### Usage

The content provider supports the following execution parameters:

```hcl
content "image" {
  # Required. For example:
  src = "some string"

  # Optional. Default value:
  alt = null
}

```
