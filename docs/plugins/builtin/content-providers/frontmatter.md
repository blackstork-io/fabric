{{< plugin-resource-header "blackstork/builtin" "builtin" "v0.4.1" "frontmatter" "content provider" >}}

The content provider is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.


#### Configuration

The content provider doesn't support any configuration parameters.

#### Usage

The content provider supports the following execution parameters:

```hcl
content frontmatter {
  # Optional string. Default value:
  format = null

  # Optional map of any single type. Default value:
  content = null
}
```
