## Description
Produces the frontmatter.

The content provider is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.


#### Configuration

The content provider doesn't support any configuration arguments.

#### Usage

The content provider supports the following execution arguments:

```hcl
content frontmatter {
  # Format of the frontmatter.
  #
  # Optional string.
  # Must be one of: "yaml", "toml", "json"
  # Default value:
  format = "yaml"

  # Arbitrary key-value map to be put in the frontmatter.
  #
  # Required data.
  # Must have a length of at least 1
  # For example:
  content = {
    key = "arbitrary value"
    key2 = {
      "can be nested" = 42
    }
  }
}
```
