## Description
Creates a queryable key-value map from the block's contents

The data source is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.

## Configuration

The data source doesn't support configuration.

## Usage

The data source supports the following parameters in the data blocks:

```hcl
data inline {
  # Arbitrary structure of (possibly nested) blocks and attributes.
  # For example:
  #   key1 = "value1"
  #   nested {
  #     blocks {
  #       key2 = 42
  #     }
  #   }

}
```
