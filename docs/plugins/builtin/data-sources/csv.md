## Description
Imports and parses a csv file.

We assume the table has a header and turn each line into a map based on the header titles.

For example following table

| column_A | column_B | column_C |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Test     | true     | 42       |
| Line 2   | false    | 4.2      |

will be represented as the following structure:
```json
[
  {"column_A": "Test", "column_B": true, "column_C": 42},
  {"column_A": "Line 2", "column_B": false, "column_C": 4.2}
]
```

The data source is built-in, which means it's a part of `fabric` binary. It's available out-of-the-box, no installation required.

## Configuration

The data source supports the following configuration parameters:

```hcl
config data csv {
  # CSV field delimiter
  #
  # Optional string.
  # Must have a length of 1
  # Default value:
  delimiter = ","
}
```

## Usage

The data source supports the following parameters in the data blocks:

```hcl
data csv {
  # Required string.
  # Must have a length of at least 1
  # For example:
  path = "path/to/file.csv"
}
```
