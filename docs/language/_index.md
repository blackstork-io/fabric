# Fabric Configuration Language 

Fabric Configuration Language (FCL) serves as the core feature for Fabric â€” a powerful tool designed to streamline document generation. FCL enables users to express data requirements and template structures within configuration files with lightweight syntax.

The document templates defined in the configuration files act as blueprints for data consolidation and creation of Markdown documents.

FCL empowers users to define, manage, and automate the document production process, delivering a sturdy and adaptable solution for content generation.

Fabric configuration files have extension `.fabric` and contain configurations, data requirements and content definitions. Fabric configuration codebase can consist of multiple files and sub-directories.

## Core Concepts

Similar to [Terraform Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language), FCL is based on [HCL syntax](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl), that consists of two core elements:

- **Blocks** are containers that define an object, like a configuration, a data requirement or a content structure. Blocks always have a block type, zero or more labels, and can be named or anonymous.
- **Arguments** assign a value to a name inside a blocks.

```hcl
# Named data block:

data elasticsearch "alerts" {
    index = ".alerts-security.alerts-*"
    query_string = "kibana.alert.severity:critical"
}

<BLOCK-TYPE> <PLUGIN> "<BLOCK-NAME>" {
    <ARGUMENT> = <VALUE>
}


# Anonymous configuration block for a data plugin:

config data elasticsearch {
    cloud_id = "my-elastic-cloud-id"
    api_key = "my-elastic-cloud-api-key"
}


<CONFIG-LABEL> <BLOCK-TYPE> <PLUGIN> {
    <ARGUMENT> = <VALUE>
}
```


See [Syntax](./syntax/) for more details on the FCL syntax.


## IDE Support

Since Fabric configuration language is based on HCL, IDE extensions for HCL syntax highlighting will work with Fabric files out of the box.

If you are using Microsoft VSCode, take a look at [Fabric Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/blackstork-io/vscode-fabric).
