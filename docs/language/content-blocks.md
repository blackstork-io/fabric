# Content blocks

`content` blocks define document segments: text paragraphs, tables, graphs, lists, etc.

The block signature includes the name of the content provider that will execute the content block.

```hcl
# Root-level definition of a content block
content <content-provider-name> "<block-name>" {
  ...
}

document "foobar" {

  # In-document named definition of a content block
  content <content-provider-name> "<block-name>" {
    ...
  }

  # In-document anonymous definition of a content block
  content <content-provider-name> {
    ...
  }

}
```

The order of the `content` blocks in the template determines the order of the generated content in the document.

If the block is placed at the root level of the file, outside of the `document` block, both names – the content provider name and the block name – are required. A combination of block type `content`, content provider name, and block name serves as a unique identifier of a block within the codebase.

If the content block is defined within the document template, only a content provider name is required and a block name is optional.

A content block is rendered by a specified content provider. See [Content Providers]({{< ref "content-providers.md" >}}) for the list of the content providers supported by Fabric.

## Supported arguments

The arguments provided in the block are either generic arguments or provider-specific arguments.

### Generic arguments

- `config`: (optional) a reference to a named configuration block for the content provider. If
  provided, it takes precedence over the default configuration. See content provider
  [configuration details]({{< ref "configs.md#block-configuration" >}}) for more information.
- `local_var`: (optional) a shortcut for specifying a local variable. See [Variables]({{< ref
  "context.md#variables" >}}) for the details.

### Content provider arguments

Content provider arguments differ per content provider. See the documentation for a specific content provider (find it in [Content Providers]({{< ref "content-providers.md" >}}) documentation) for the details on the supported arguments.

## Supported nested blocks

- `meta`: (optional) a block containing metadata for the block. See [Metadata]({{< ref "configs.md#metadata" >}}) for details.
- `config`: (optional) an inline configuration for the block. If provided, it takes precedence over the `config` argument and default configuration for the content provider.
- `vars`: (optional) a block with variable definitions. See [Variables]({{< ref
  "context.md#variables" >}}) for the details.

## References

See [References]({{< ref references.md >}}) for the details about referencing content blocks.

## Example

FIXME: TORUN
```hcl
config content openai_text "test_account" {
  # Reading a key from an environment variable
  api_key = env.FABRIC_OPENAI_KEY
}

document "test-doc" {

  vars {
    items = ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"]
  }

  content text {
    # Query contains a JQ query executed against the context
    local_var = ".vars.items | length"

    # The context can be accessed in Go templates
    value = "There are {{ .vars.local }} items: {{ .vars.items | toPrettyJson }}"
  }

  content openai_text {
    config = config.content.openai_text.test_account

    prompt = <<-EOT
       Write a short story, just a paragraph, about space exploration
       using the values from the provided items list as character names:

       {{ .vars.items | toPrettyJson }}
    EOT
  }
}
```

produces the following output:

```text
There are 3 items

In the vast expanse of the universe, three brave astronauts, aaa, bbb, and ccc, embarked on
a daring mission of space exploration. As they soared through the galaxies, their unwavering
determination and unyielding teamwork propelled them towards uncharted territories,
uncovering hidden wonders and pushing the boundaries of human understanding.
Together, aaa, bbb, and ccc, etched their names in the stars as pioneers of a new era,
forever inspiring generations to dream beyond the confines of Earth.
```
