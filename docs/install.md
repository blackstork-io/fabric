# Install

To get started with Fabric, follow these simple steps for installation across various operating systems:

- **download release archives**: choose and download the appropriate release for your operating system (Windows, macOS/Darwin, or Linux) and architecture in ["Releases" section](https://github.com/blackstork-io/fabric/releases);
- **unpack the archives**: extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a preferred directory;
- **run the binary**: run `fabric` binary from the command line to launch Fabric.

That's it! You're now ready to use Fabric. For more details on usage and configuration options, refer [Fabric CLI]({{< ref "cli.md" >}}) documentation.
