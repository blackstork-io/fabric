**Fabric** is an open-source CLI tool and a configuration language that codifies and automates content generation for cyber-security and compliance.

Fabric renders documents from the modular templates written in [Fabric Configuration Language](https://blackstork.io/fabric/docs/language/) (FCL). The template authors can define the data requirements and content structure inside the template, reducing manual overhead of data consolidation.

The ecosystem of plugins provides various integrations with popular platforms, data stores and security solutions: JSON/CSV files, Elastic Security, OpenCTI, Splunk Cloud, GitHub, etc. You can find the list of the supported plugins in [the documentation](https://blackstork.io/fabric/docs/plugins/).

To enable flexible content generation, Fabric plugins provide powerful [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and generative AI / LLMs (OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI, etc) capabilities.

See [the documentation](https://blackstork.io/fabric/docs/) for more details about Fabric.

> [!NOTE]  
> Fabric is currently in the early stages of development, and there may be some issues. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or encounter bugs, please share them in [Fabric Community slack](https://fabric-community.slack.com/).
