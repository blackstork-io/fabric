Fabric produces rich Markdown documents from the template files that declaratively define data requirements and content structure. The templates consist of reusable blocks powered by plugins. Fabric fetches data from various external data stores, security solutions, and platforms using a collection of integrations and renders the Markdown document through a set of content blocks. Since the output file is just a Markdown document, it can be quickly rendered into PDF / HTML using any 3rd party renderer.
