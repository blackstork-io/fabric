Fabric produces Markdown documents from the templates that define data requirements and content structure. The templates are written in Fabric Configuration Language and consist of reusable blocks, powered by plugins.
Data blocks fetch data from various external sources -- data stores, security solutions, and platforms. The content blocks render the template into a Markdown document.

See [Documentation](https://blackstork.io/fabric/docs/) for more details on the Fabric language and Fabric CLI.
